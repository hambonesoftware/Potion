# Phase 1 — Domain Models & Persistence

**Goal**: Define core models and repositories using SwiftData; stubs for search index.

## Tasks
- Implement SwiftData models for Village, Plant, Activity, Document, SectionChunk.
- Repositories with async methods and in-memory fakes for tests.
- Seed data and CRUD screens (basic SwiftUI lists/forms).
- Set up GRDB package and create empty FTS tables (no data yet).

## Acceptance
- Add/edit/delete Plants and Villages.
- Unit tests for repos pass.
